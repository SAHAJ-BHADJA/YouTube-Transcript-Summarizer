# YouTube-Transcript-Summarizer

Enhanced performance of the state-of-the-art PEGASUS Transformer model for summarizing conversational texts by fine-tuning and hypermeter tuning. 
It generates concise summaries for dialogue-type texts and YouTube Transcripts.
Improved the ROUGE score of pre-trained models for conversational texts from 0.01552 to 0.018547.

Dataset used: SAMSUM
The SAMSum dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. We used this dataset for fine-tuning PEGASUS in YouTube Transcript Summarization because YouTube videos can also be sometimes considered as conversational videos.
